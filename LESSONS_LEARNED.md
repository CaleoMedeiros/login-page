1. Every time I create a website I must put it in "English" instead of my native language, because it's a pattern.

2. What is semantic HTML?

- Semantic HTML is typing in the most correctly way possible, e.g. instead of using "divs" I use sections because it is a section of the website, instead of a divisor (div).

3. B.E.M. pattern (Block Element Modifier)

- What is a B.E.M pattern?
  It is a CSS pattern to make it easier to understand the scopes of a class in the HTML
  e.g. `c-right-side` is a block, `c-right-side__button` is an element, `c-right-side__button--disabled` is a modifier.

4. Default CSS reset
